## How to build:

In order to build the iOS project, you will need to add a `Config.xcconfig` file inside the [iosApp/Assets](https://github.com/prof18/MoneyFlow/tree/main/iosApp/Assets) folder, with the content of the [Config.xcconfig.template](https://github.com/prof18/MoneyFlow/blob/main/iosApp/Assets/Config.xcconfig.template) file. 

### Dropbox sync:

If you want to run the Dropbox sync, you need to create a Dropbox App [here](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/) and get an API key. For iOS, you need to provide also the URL scheme and both need to be placed in the `Config.xcconfig` file created above:

```xcconfing
DROPBOX_URL_SCHEME=db-<your-api-key>
DROPBOX_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

On Android, you only need the   key, which must be included in the `local.properties` in the root project dir:

```properties
dropbox.app_key=<your-api-key>
```
